curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the 105.98748779296875

great opposition of character.--bingley was endeared to darcy by the 48.59242630004883
easiness, openness, ductility of his temper, though no disposition could 104.83064270019531

them to be playing high she declined it, and making her sister the 645.2644653320312

     from what passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was 303.3275451660156
     confirmed, and every inducement heightened, which could have led me 339.9724426269531
     before, to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy 509.64605712890625
     connection.--he left netherfield for london, on the day following, 152.8043212890625
     as you, i am certain, remember, with the design of soon 71.98957061767578
     returning.--the part which i acted, is now to be explained.--his 175.56414794921875
     sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our 1290.9801025390625
     coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike sensible 506.7190856933594
     that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly 127.85945129394531
     resolved on joining him directly in london.--we accordingly 1283.9410400390625
     went--and there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to 386.74188232421875
     my friend, the certain evils of such a choice.--i described, and 183.2940216064453
     enforced them earnestly.--but, however this remonstrance might have 311.00634765625
     staggered or delayed his determination, i do not suppose that it 28.462739944458008
     would ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been 94.44800567626953
     seconded by the assurance which i hesitated not in giving, of your 108.49050903320312
     sister's indifference.one cannot wonder that so 184.5070343017578
